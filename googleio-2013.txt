Autoscaling Java ==============================================================
    dropwizard
    jmeter 

    autoscaling happens in a _brief_ period of time, which is why spinup time is so important

    cloud antipatterns
        large deployments (complex dependencies, lots of artifacts)
            ? are we trying to reduce spinup time per instance?
        automatic class instantiation
        code generation (at _runtime_)
            - workaround: use compile-time generation instead
            - even if you generate at compile-time, permgen becomes a problem, and JVM tuning for ephemeral instances is tough
        managing shared state (crosstalk amongst applications)
        persisting configuration
            - build configration into the source code instead

Dart ==========================================================================
Dart VM developed by the same guys who developed V8

    DOM

    JS engine

    optimize: low startup latency, high perf, low memory usage, small pauses
    minimize: big GC pauses, memory leaks, erratic performance

2006: the browser parsed the js, creates AST, and walks over the AST with an interpreter

2013: 
    parse JS
    multi-tier adaptive compilation / series of compilers that adapts to different usage patterns
    _deoptimization_ if user behavior changes
    generational garbage collection
        native code is generated en masse on the fly, and discarded as patterns change
    code flushing
    code flushing
    support debugging and profiling

multi-tier adaptive compilation

V8 GC
    2-phase: old space => new space
    stop-the-world collection, single-threaded
    store-buffer for generations

DOM nodes are GC'd via reference counting
    problems: 
        reference count doesn't say which objects point to an object
        doesn't handle cycles

DOM "dance" is the hardest part of optimizing JS performance
    animations skip frames because of GC pauses, deoptimization

in order to fix the DOM dance problem, the reference-counted nature of the DOM must be changed
solution: make _all_ objects subject to tracing
    -> concurrent manipulation of DOM (cf. current ref-counted implementaion which requires a lock to mainpulate DOM)

optional types are better than no types

Q/A:
    asm.js payload is too large; can't use many JS features like garbage collection, 
        source langs are limited
    can't send "strict mode" flag to JS engine because the JS engine would have to 
        trust the code (no security/sandbox)
    GWT to Dart will be a reality if/when Dart VM exists in most browsers
    Dart on Dart VM will still have ~2x perf gains even compared to GWT=>JS
    dart2js is often slower than hand-written JS because it must check bounds, etc.
    ? Dart VM vs NaCl
    ? if Dart VM is never shipped, is dart2js compelling enough?


GWT ===========================================================================
for most cases, just extend Composite directly instead of going full MVP

"testing widgets from normal java tests isn't that hard anymore
GWTMockUtilities
    mock widgets directly! (GWTTestCase not needed)
GwtMockito
    @RunWith(GwtMockitoTestRunner.class)

good practice:
    think of events as notifications, _not_ commands
    events are usually fired only for:
        user input
        server responses
    events do not have return values


Dart: new features ============================================================
SIMD extensions

Future.wait
Future.then
Stream = "repeating Future"

Dart compiler, compiled to JS: try.dartlang.org

Dart package manager: pub.dartlang.org 


Google Knowledge Graph / Freebase API =========================================

freebase.com
    crowd-sourced
    10k requests/day for free
    entire graph is downloadable

edges (relationships) in a graph allow us to treat two entities with the same name as different

Autosuggest: turn ambiguous keywords into unique identifiers
    HTTP query => JSON response

Semantic Tagging
    use freebase vocabulary as a vocabulary for meaningful tags in your application

Entity Collections

Geosearch Collections

Topical Weblinks


GWT roadmap ===================================================================
http://www.gwtproject.org/
https://github.com/gwtproject

compiler:
    GWT 3.0 / 2014:
        GWT compiler may be producing sub-optimal code for modern JS engines
        commitment to improve GWTTestCase 
        GWT 3 will remove support for ie6/7/8 

    mobile
        offline support
        app store support

    GWT is in a unique position to optimize performance, because it knows about 
    _all_ of your resources and how they fit together:
        gzip single deliverable
        async/defer <script>
        nocache.js 
        compiler easily outputs correct manifest for HTML 5 AppCache
        batch data calls via Scheduler/gwt-dispatch

    parsing
        parsing JS _blocks_ the UI!

    layout
        CSS layout is essentially _native_ because it goes to the browser layout engine
        flexbox

    animation
        no js animation


Wireless crash course =========================================================
wireless != wired. different constraints, performance characteristics
users expect mobile to be _faster_ than desktop, so it is unacceptable to

radio perf: wifi vs mobile

    wifi
        _shared_medium_, so each device has to play nice
        "everyone can't talk at the same time", so algorithm randomly backs off if it can't find a "slot"

        at-home test: how long for a packet to get from laptop to router?
            2.5 GHz router: :90th percentile => 15ms! (same time it takes to travel across US)
            5 GHz router: 2ms

        dealing with variable bandwith
            adaptive bitrate 

    2G/3G/4G
        idle to connected negotation 
            3G: up to 2.5s
            LTE: 100ms


1s+ => mental context switch
    "trivial inconvenience"! http://lesswrong.com/lw/f1/beware_trivial_inconveniences/

LTE
    more reliable latency, less jitter

mobile radio is optimized for burst data
batch requests
use decay function to retry/backoff

client device antennae energy use is dictated by the radio tower--not the device!

asm.js

    2× native performance 
        no multithreading 
        no SIMD
        huge payload
        doesn't make sense for a VM/GC source, because the entire source vm would need to be compiled to asm.js

    benchmarks:

        Dhrystone and Whetstone 
            floating/int ops, function calls, string manipulation, and array accessing

            score measures FLOPS


    Emscripten has no access to SIMD because the Firefox scripting engine doesn't know how to produce vector code.
        cf. Dart

    cannot execute in parallel 
        cf. Dart "isolates" take advantage of multi-core machines
            spawn a function into an isolate which can then be run in a separate thread. Isolates are "isolated memory heaps", and they communicate via message passing

    payload is "huge":
        The JavaScript programs that Emscripten produces are huge. The binary-tree 
        test, for example, results in a 16,896 byte native code executable. Its 
        JavaScript counterparts are 379,784 bytes for regular JavaScript and 667,207 bytes for asm.js.

    relevance to GWT:
        some things in Java simply are not implemented in GWT, eg:
            finalize() is never called in GWT, because the JS GC does not have such a concept
            http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13377685/gwt-finalize-object-and-remove-its-event-handlers

Dart
    Dart can be optimized better than Javascript for similar reasons that Lua 
    can be optimized, and Candor:
    https://github.com/indutny/candor

    Alex Gaynor perspective on dynamic tracing: 
        https://speakerdeck.com/alex/why-python-ruby-and-javascript-are-slow

    supports SIMD

    Dart "isolates":
        exploit multi-core machines
        spawn a function into an isolate to run in a separate thread
        Isolates are "isolated memory heaps"
        communicate via message-passing

    importance of avoiding premature layouts:
        http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/efficient-javascript/?page=3#reflow
            repaint = element visibility change without altering layout
                expensive because the browser must verify the visibility of all other nodes in the DOM tree
            reflow 
                implicitly causes a repaint
                occurs on any of:
                    DOM tree change
                    style change affecting layout
                    element class change
                    viewport resize!!
                expensive because often equivalent to laying out the entire page 
            Avoid tables for layout: even minor changes will cause reflows of all other nodes in the table
                use a fixed layout for data tables to allow a more efficient layout algorithm. Any value for table-layout other than "auto" will trigger a fixed layout and allow the table to render row by row
