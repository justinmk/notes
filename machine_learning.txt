    └─  _Transfer Learning_
        "Easiest way to use deep learning without a lot of data: download
        a pretrained model and fine-tune the last few layers on your small
        dataset. In many domains (like image classification) fine-tuning works
        extremely well, because the pretrained model has learned generic
        features in the early layers that are useful for many datasets, not
        just the one trained on. Even the best skin cancer classifier
        (http://www.nature.com/articles/nature21056) was pretrained on ImageNet.

        └─ "This is how the great http://course.fast.ai course begins - download VGG16,
        |   finetune the top layer with a single dense layer, get amazing results. The
        |   second or third class shows how to make the top layers a bit more complex to get
        |   even better accuracy."

        └─ Remove the last "layer" of the neural net. Then you can use
           a classifier (e.g. SVM) to add the layer back, for your specific
           application. E.g. with deep learning, the NN finds features, these
           are in the last "hidden layer". That layer is generalized, you can
           use those features to train for your specific application.
