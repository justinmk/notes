Neovim / brain dump

"Foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds".
But also the converse: foolish liberty. Constraints are useful for reasoning about a system.

Why excited about neovim?
- fast engine, luajit, not available in any other major editor
- small, therefore cheap and flexible. Can spin up dozens of peers.
- the structures and conventions are already there in Vim culture, just need to build on top of it
- solve problems for many people. Fixing things in a personal config is a drag.
- reach many people, but remember: slowness and deliberation are also features. Knowing that upstream is not going to pull the rug out is very valuable to users. This also applies to emacs, but the plugin culture doesn't follow it: most require latest Emacs.
- neovim is a pivot. Very fancy new UIs are being pioneered in VScode, sublime, atom, intellij. We should reuse that work, not reinvent it.

achievements:
- Nvim provides portable downloads for Linux, macOS, and Windows.
  No install required, so you can use Nvim on a Windows server or macOS without
  clicking through an installer.
- Only Nvim offers a macOS binary, not Vim.

role of Vim in 2015:
    emacs/vim are in the class "lifestyle editors" (absurdly customizable). It
    is an identity that this type of application will continue to be a niche
    (define niche as <5% of developers), because as soon as it is _not_ a niche,
    it will be addressed by the popular projects (eclipse, VS) and vim/emacs
    will then become historical curiosities (only used by the "collector class")
    instead of first-order productivity tools.

    lack of constraints (customization) causes entropy:

project management:
    be friendly to everyone because: they may be testing the waters, don't scare
    them away (don't assume users are being "lazy", maybe they are just new)

    why do we care about popularity? free bug testers. more users => more robust

    reputation is valuable: tarruda's tmux commits gave him reputation
    ...but confidence and delivery are more valuable (again, this usually comes from one's past experience)

working together:
    trust networks work
    intuition is the #1 most important characteristic of a project member
        OSS projects organically select for this (formal orgs / commercial
        companies can't, so they have hyper-reactive interview processes)

lessons from bram/Vim:
    ignore drive-by opinions
    back compat is a feature
    lack of features _can be_ a feature, if the plugin solution is not a burden

    http://www.agide.org
    Bram's own Agide project once had aspirations of a similar sort of extensibility
    as Neovim: Agide is not a monolitic application. Separate tools can be plugged
    in. Thus you are not forced to use one editor. ... Each tool implements part of
    the plugin interface. Even Stefan Monnier admits that in some cases a fork is
    necessary: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2015-01/msg00171.html

    https://code.google.com/archive/p/codecheck/
    Another attempt sponsored by Bram to provide "IDE features" in Vim.
    > CodeCheck is a script (or a set of scripts), which will provide on-the-fly code checking for Vim. It will basically mimic the similar feature in Eclipse IDE.

    http://www.free-soft.org/FSM/english/issue01/vim.html Bram's equation for number
    of contributors to a project:
        available = interested x ability x motivation
    "...The motivation factor is the big unknown in this formula. How many of the
    people that are able to write the program are actually willing to do it?"

Neovim is a fork, though you may call it a knife.

neovim vision:
    stability of runtime
    stability of UI decisions
    [don't break userspace] prime directive for a fork is: do not regress from origin.

people are willing to pay for things that are good.
...but marketing is still a requirement.

open source has a powerful ability to fill in the "wide but shallow" work by sourcing small,
one-time commits from the "long tail" of passers-by

tools matter documentation matters branding matters attitude matters: neovim
attracts even C novices and winds up getting very useful commits from people who
might otherwise have been intimidated professionalism matters There are a few
things that impress me with the neovim project
1. The speed in the refactoring.
2. The (apparent) ability to come to a consensus quickly.
3. The quality and depth of the communication of the progress and ideas.
   https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7862576 Incredible, how fast they move.
   And it feels very professional & friendly.

how to make a fork succeed:


build a "big tent": be compatible with origin as much as possible; users should
be able to move to the fork with zero effort keep the vibe positive,
professional, and welcoming. co-opt untapped resources even amateur C devs have
made many valuable contributions to Neovim Neovim attracted devs that were
turned off by the old development model solve the pain points and don't
introduce new ones. stay focused, avoid feature creep, avoid hero complex. be
able to benefit from "upstream" with very little effort "duplicate" work? avoid
duplicate work by porting keeping up with upstream changes "divided" effort?
Most Neovim devs did not previously work on Vim source, so this is work that is
being done that otherwise would have been directed elsewhere (for better or
worse...) Neovim has contributed to other important projects: luarocks timeout
handling CC handling libuv mkdtemp function improved performance of uv_hrtime

why vim instead of emacs?

1. Vim is a manageable quanitity (~300k LOC + VimL, vs Emacs 300k for core + 1M
   elisp)

2. guile emacs isn't anywhere close to becoming a reality:

   Ulrich Bayirli/Kammer If some Emacs developers gave Guile-Emacs some love, it
   might land in a couple years I'd guess

Being able to easily extend emacs with arbitrary languages isn't going to happen
in the next 10 years. And, as silly as it sounds, that's going to hamper
popularity and development, because most people won't learn elisp to get
a feature they want. They'll implement the feature in python for sublime, or
javascript for atom--or python or javascript, for Neovim. Emacs has a lot of
baggage to juggle. Vim has an order of magnitude less baggage (300k LOC vs 1.5
million LOC). This means that Vim has traditionally had relatively fewer
features, but that's going to change because Neovim will catalyze an inflection
point. The un-cleverness of the VimL interpreter also turned out to be
a blessing for this reason, because re-implementing it is a cakewalk compared to
re-implementing elisp.

http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/04/xemacs-is-dead-long-live-xemacs.html
A lot of people were switching over to XEmacs by the mid-1990s: the fancy
widgets and pretty colors attracted GNU Emacs users like moths to a bug-zapper.
Problem was, it could actually zap you. The downside of the Bazaar I personally
tried to use XEmacs many times over a period of many years. I was jealous of its
features. However, I never managed to use XEmacs for very long, because it
crashed a lot. ... I assume its propensity for inopportune heart attacks is
a function of several things, including (a) old-school development without unit
tests, (b) the need to port it to a gazillion platforms, including many that
nobody actually uses, (c) a culture of rapid addition of new features. ...
[importance of defaults and out-of-the-box sanity:] Emacs, like Firefox, can be
configured to back up your state periodically, so that in theory it can recover
after a crash. That's part of the problem: you didn't actually have to configure
Firefox to get that behavior. It does it automatically. ... Features and
stability aside, XEmacs is looking pretty shabby in the performance department.
... If Emacs can't find a way to evolve into (or merge with) Firefox, then
Firefox or some other extensible browser is going to eclipse Emacs. [emacs-devel
has essentially guaranteed JS interop won't happen, and refuses to use non-GPL
code in general] ... Emacs also needs to take a page from the JVM/CLR/Parrot
efforts and treat itself as a VM (that's what it is, for all intents) and start
offering first-class support for other languages.  [emacs-devel has essentially
guaranteed this won't happen] ... [CLR-hosted language interop] is clearly one
of the hardest technical challenges facing our industry for the next 10 years,
but it's also one of the most obviously necessary. And Emacs is going to have to
play that game. I'm not talking about hacked-together process bridges like
PyMacs or el4r, either — I mean first-class support and all that it entails.
[Neovim is a bid to see where a hacked-together bridge takes us :)]

> The Emacs core is fairly small, compared with his Elisp codebase.

The emacs core is actually about ~300k lines of C, same as Vim. The rest is more
than 1 million lines of elisp, whereas Vim has about ~100k lines of viml. That
elisp code does a lot and is difficult to change (guilemacs is the best chance
they have, but it is at least 5 years away from truly replacing emacs as we know
it).

Emacs is a better concept but Vim has relatively much less *baggage* which
allows it to be "pivoted" instead of slowly fading into irrelevance. Neovim
turns things inside out, that's why it's very interesting (let emacs do its
thing, but try this other thing at the same time; parallel experiments). Neovim
is only possible because Vim is comparatively "incomplete": think of it as
a starter kit. The Neovim experiment cannot practically be applied to emacs, for
technical, cultural, and legal reasons (RMS/Eli/Stephan do not like non-GPL
extensions, they don't even like MELPA).

> I guess it allowed you to modify more parts of your Emacs experience.

It does, and yet some key parts aren't practically modifiable in a useful way.
Defaults, conventions, and culture matter, extremely so when you're trying to
adopt an editor with thousands of concepts. If those concepts and the culture
have missing pieces, then you don't benefit from the network effects of other
users/plugins/documentation. Beyond a certain thresholds, saying "you can change
emacs as you like" is the same as saying "you can build your own editor". That
is a cop-out because if most users wanted to build an editor they wouldn't be
looking for an already-existing editor.

So I'm interested in an editor that has strong defaults/conventions, and
provides useful hooks and gets out of the way everywhere else. Emacs culture has
a counterproductive obsession with re-inventing everything in elisp. Imagine how
many things could have been improved if, instead of building CEDET, they had
leverage existing external tools. Now CEDET has reached a moderate maturity, yet
it's eclipsed by things like clang (which GNU crowd refuses to touch)...
