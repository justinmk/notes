PERNIL SOFRITO

- ~5 lbs pork shoulder (aka pork butt)
    - Serves 1 for about a week.

1. Get a long knife.
2. In a pilón (mortar and pestle) smash up a ~5 cloves of garlic (i.e., half of a garlic bulb), some sazon, salt, pepper, and oil. Grind it up good. 
    - Now you have a "ghetto sofrito".
3. Pre-heat oven to ~300 F.
4. Take your knife and stab some holes (or deep slits) in the pork. Twist the knife to make the holes nice and wide.
5. Stuff some sofrito into the holes. Use the remainder to coat the outside of the meat. Add salt and pepper. 
6. Throw the pork in skin/fat-side up and wait. Do _not_ cover with foil.
7. It's going to take ~45 minutes a pound. After ~1.5 hours, test it with a meat thermometer (remember to not rest it on the bone, or you will get a bad reading).
8. At 150-160 F, crank the stove up to 400 F. This will give you a delicious, crispy skin/fat.
9. At ~170 F, pull it out, but _don't_ carve it up. Wait at least 10 minutes, otherwise the juices will dribble out.

TOSTONES

- Green plantains (not ripe). Usually 5 for $1.
    - If you have ripe plantains, you could make _maduros_ (amarillos) instead of tostones.
- Bacon
- Flour

1. Fry some bacon. Set the bacon aside and save the fat.
2. Take a plantain and run a knife down the side and split the skin off without breaking the plantain. This takes a bit of practice.
3. Slice up the plantain into ~1/3 inch thick slices. Throw them into a bowl of ice water.
4. Use a deep fryer or else pour ~1/2 inches of oil into a frying pan. Corn oil works best, olive oil smokes too easily. Get it very hot. Throw in the bacon grease.
5. Take your sliced up plantains out of the ice water and drain them or even pat them with a paper towel until they're dry.
6. Fry them until they just turn golden.
7. Throw them in the freezer for 10 minutes.
8. Here's the fun part: Get a flat bottom glass and a cutting board or a plate. Throw some flour on there. Smash the plantains with the cup. You may need a spatula to get them off the board.
9. Fry them _again_ until they are golden and crispy. Drain on a paper towel until dry.

Tostones take condiments well; try a spicy hot sauce such as Salsa Huichol.
