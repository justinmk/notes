EC2
    Get metadata of the current EC2 instance
    https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html
        Amazon Linux ships with ec2-metadata tool:
            $ /opt/aws/bin/ec2-metadata
        Magic endpoint "169.254.169.254" gives metadata of the current instance:
            $ curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/


DevOps at amazon:
    key characteristics of Amazon SOA:
        - tools have *best-practices* baked-in, in order to improve
          *discoverability* and self-service (naming conventions, common
          protocols, failure modes, ...)
        - tools (services) must be self-service (tool should *not* require
          hand-holding for other teams to implement)
        - tools (services) must be decoupled from other tools (otherwise SOA is
          pointless)
    SOA is not effective unless it is combined with organizational changes:
        - small teams (6-8)
        - teams have full ownership and accountability
        - incentives are aligned within a given team

CloudTrail
    S3 for medium-term storage; glacier for long-term.
    use pre-defined CloudFormation template

    Aggregate multiple AWS accounts to a _single_ S3 bucket.
        Enable CloudTrail in all accounts.
        Configure S3 bucket policy to authorize CloudTrail requests from the
        AWS accounts.

ECS: EC2 container service
    The "primitive" for distributed applications: task (job)
    Think about "pool of resources" (cluster...), _not_ machines.
    https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-cli
        "Run applications locally or on ECS using the same Docker Compose file
        format and familiar Compose commands."

    Task
    https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=175819
    "When creating a task, you can omit the 'Host port' option (or set it to 0)
    and a port will automatically be chosen when it's started. You can find out
    which port was chosen by describing the running task."


Lambda
    - Don't need to worry about: servers, capacity, deployment, scaling,
      fault-tolerance, OS/stack updates, metrics/logging
    - Never pay for idle
    Built-in support for CloudWatch metrics/logs
    Lambda blueprints: templates/quickstarts
    Scheduled Lambdas (cron)

Glacier
    Lifecycle rules: automatically archive S3 data after expiration.
    Best practices: Store the filename in the Description field.

AWS Config: visibility into configuration changes
    configuration item (CI): standard config format
        metadata
        common attributes (resource ID, type, ARN, zone)
        relationships
        current config
        related events: GUID that defines CloudTrail event
    CI and diff delivered to SNS on every change
    Config Rules: built upon AWS Config
        AWS-managed rules (pre-built)
            "All resources must be tagged"
        custom rules (lambda)

Network trouble / cannot connect
    "If you associate an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC and subnets, your route
    tables must include separate routes for IPv6 traffic."
    http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Scenario2.html

    502 Bad Gateway
        If the ALB considers all instances "unhealthy", it will route to "all",
        and you will get random 502 errors depending on which node was routed-to.
