parts:
  x raspberry pi 4, model B, 2GB ram
  x power connector adapter: XT60 male to Deans(T) female
  x lipo battery alarm: attach to battery to avoid completely discharging the battery (dangerous)

  x 3d printed
  x soldering iron
  x raspi
    multimeter
    (optional) IMU setup: BNO080 IMU + Teensy LC
  x feet: for slippery surface, get rubber grommets (McMaster #90131A101) and fasten them to the pre-drilled holes in the feet.
  x       "Any sort of rubber disc/washer. Attach with short M3x8 screws and locknuts."

LIPO BATTERY:
  Always charge in BALANCE mode.
  DISCHARGING TOO MUCH = risk of fire.
    Below 3V per-cell => permanent degradation.
    Set "low-voltage cutoff" to 3.4V per cell.
  Safest charge-rate for LiPo batteries is 1C, or 1x capacity of battery in Amps.
    => for 5200mAh battery use 5.2A
    if charger doesn't support 5.2A it's fine to use a lower value, just takes longer
  STORAGE:
    Always set LiPo to "storage charge" if you won't use it same-day.
    Proper LiPo storage voltage = 3.8V per cell
    LiPo battery can be damaged by sitting fully charged for as little as 1 week.

HARDWARE
  servo motor "crackling" noise:
  https://www.rctech.net/forum/nitro-road/283356-servo-noise-normal.html
    > The crackling is perfectly normal with digital servos. It usually happens
    > when there is a very slight load on the servo and it can't quite reach
    > neutral perfectly to stop calling on the motor. There isn't any negative
    > effect, but as a rule I wouldn't leave it loaded and crackling for minutes
    > at a time.


SOFTWARE
  problems:
    # wlan fails in ro filesystem:
    Feb 14 10:19:29 oppy5 dhclient[2930]: can't create /var/lib/dhcp/dhclient.wlan0.leases: Read-only file system
  $ ssh pi@10.0.0.99  # ethernet
  $ ssh pi@192.168.2.110  # wifi
  use of `dd` to flash the sd card: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/mac.md

  "using latest raspbian OS: The only thing that needed to be corrected were missing udev rules for the PS4 controller. Otherwise the software instructions were sufficient." https://groups.google.com/d/msg/stanford-quadrupeds/e01e9xvb4V4/2o81D3CeBwAJ
  # update wifi:
  sudo raspi-config
  # At boot, files are overwritten with /boot/appliance/*.
  # To preserve wifi settings:
  sudo cp /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf /boot/appliance/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
  # control ps4 colors, ...:
  vim StanfordQuadruped/pupper/HardwareConfig.py

  behavior
    Q1: Robot walks too fast. How can I control the speed of the robot?
    A1: You can adjust the frequency of the trot in the config file here:
        https://github.com/stanfordroboticsclub/StanfordQuadruped/blob/master/pupper/Config.py.
        Look for two variables: self.overlap_time and self.swing_time
