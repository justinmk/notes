keynote
=======

Cromwell said unequivocally that if Dart maintains a 2-3x speedup over v8, GWT will compile to it.

~650 conference attendees
3x increase in external contrib since creation of steering committee
1000s of internal google users
    - Google Shopping Express
    - new Google spreadsheets is written in GWT!
        - cross-compiled betw GWT <-> j2objc
        - large code-sharing of Java logic betw server and multiple client targets
~100k users of SDK

avoid JSNI with @JsInterface, @JsProperty

future: zero-work interop => drop an external JS library into GWT, interfaces are automatically generated

//create three buttons and map event handlers to each of them!
    Stream<HtmlButton> buttons = Stream.of("one", "two", "three").map(Demo::create);
    buttons.each((b). -> b.addEventLIstener("click", (e) -> ...))

future: drop external JS library into GWT
    - compiler performs dead-code elimination on the external lib
    - type-checking on the external lib!

code splitting improvements
    "if you accidentally create split points between two components that share code,
    the shared code goes into the leftovers fragment, and this almost kills the benefit
    because the leftovers fragment has to be downloaded anyways. tedious, brittle."

compiler improvements: target modern browser optimizations
    - TypedArrays: new int[64] => new Int32Array(64)
    - output asm.js-like code! (type annotationson variables)
    - merging in the Closure compiler backend!
    speed
        - incremental compilation time proportional to the number of of files changed

layout
    - "Native" layout instead of JS layout
    - GssResource => CSS3 support

making mobile fly
=================
chrome://tracing
    tinyurl.com/abouttracing
    more powerful than DevTools for debugging jank

JS performance dominates, fix it first by profiling your bottlenecks, _then_ look at:
    DOM -> Style -> Layout (aka Reflow) -> Record -> Composit -> GPU
                                                           /\
                                        raster thread 1 -- raster thread N
Desktop profiling does NOT translate to mobile characteristics

text auto-sizing on mobile browsers (Chrome, Firefox) comes at a cost (~2x layout time)
    to avoid text auto-sizing:
    <meta name"viewport" content="width=device-width user-scalable=no">
        unfortunately, disables zooming

double-tap detection causes 300ms delay on first tap

RAF (request animation frame)
    synced to v-sync
    webkit-requestanimationframe
    GWT animation class updated to use RAF 
    window of 16 ms / 60hz (possibly 8ms in the future as displays improve to 120hz)
    use this instead of setTimeOut()

squashing repaints
    avoid repaints by using _layers_
    just "move a layer" instead of repaint/resize

DOM viewport _includes_ what's offscreen (~8k pixels)
    keep DOM small, "page-in lazily"

use "infinite scroll" approach even for regular pages:
    page in offscreen portions _after_ onscreen portion, makes initial
    render much faster, while still avoiding jank.

compiler
========
    optimization pass (last 3-4 steps in the diagram) are what are worked on, the other
    first steps are not touched.

    GWT Java AST   com.google.gwt.dev.jjs.ast
        class Foo {
              int x;
              void bar() {
                   x = 2 + 5;
              }
        }
        JClassType(Foo)
            JField(x)           Jmethod(bar)
                                JMethodBody
                                JBlock
                                JStatement
                                JExpression
                                JBinaryExpression
                                JFieldRef       JBinaryOperation
                                                JInLitral(2)       JInLiteral(5)

        GWT optimization:
            run optimization pass in a loop until "fixed point" (diminishing returns) is reached
                -o9 compiler flag controls how long this loop runs

            JModVisitor
                all GWT optimizations implement this

            DeadCodeElimination class
                simplest part of the compiler, best starting point for contributors
                constant-folding:
                    "if I know LHS and RHS are both int literals, I can replace them":
                    ctx.replaceMe(new JInLiteral(node.getSourceInfo(),
                                      ((JInLiteral) node.getLhs()).getValue(),
                                      ((JInLiteral) node.getRhs().getValue()),
                                      ));

            Pruner
            Finalizer: if nothing is assigned to a field, marks it as final
                       any method that is not overridden, mark it as final
                       rewrite non-static methods as static functions if possible
                            (polymorphism is expensive)
                            allows inlining
            TypeTightener

            "type explosion" is not really a concern for client code because the compiler
            knows all calls and can replace interfaces with concrete implementations

            Code Splitting
                works similar to the Pruner
                everything that is touched from the AST root is "alive", the rest is eliminated


debugger / SuperDevMode
=======================
intellij debugger seeing/planned active support, no eclipse debugger

<module>
    <!-- what was on the slide before this??? -->
    <!-- REMOVE this to improve compile speed -->
    <inherits name="com.foo.Util" />
</module>

force breakpoint in pretty-mode:
    GWT.debugger()


compiler #2 ********REVIEW => lot of good material @ 15 minutes **********
==========================================================================
compiler speed improvements focused on _draft_ compilation
    so normal compilation still needs to cycle through all the optimization passes

modularization (*.gwt.xml files) helps (will help) the compiler
break circular references
make your tree _shallow_ and _broad_
use buck/gradle => build parallelism

split points
    2.6 flag to merge fragments less than a certain size
    "left overs" fragment is a killer
    having too many split points is _detrimental_
        - more likely that "left overs" fragment touches many split points
        - therefore merging split points can be beneficial


qQuery ****REVIEW THIS TALK******
================================================================================
uses CSS3 animations when possible (cf. jQuery uses timers)

gQuery feature: DCE for 'browser' object
    if (browser.webkit) {
        ...
    } else { //eliminated if browser is not webkit
        ...
    }

//gQuery alternative to JSNI:
JsUtils.runJavascriptFunction(...)

JS libraries ported to gQuery/GWT:
    GwtChosen
    tooltips
    drag/drop

mgwt
================================================================================
keeps DOM very small
supports CSS3
adds at least 14 permutations for mobile
REVIEW ==> "web components solve the heavy event-propogation problem"
last 20 minutes: demo of using "d8" profiling method

Douglas Crockford: "Javascript did a better job than the JVM at providing
    bytecode security, perhaps because it works at a higher level"


MISSED TALK (REVIEW): JsInterop
