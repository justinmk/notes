READ results into cursor position (acme!) - http://stackoverflow.com/a/2960630 
                                            http://superuser.com/a/251959/114842
    :r!foo                  read in stdout from a shell command
    <c-r>=system('foo')
    :r [file]               read in contents of [file]
    <c-r>=&vim_variable     hint: works with tab-complete (wildmenu)
    <c-r>=SomeFunction()
    <c-r>[register_name]    % # : .

WRITE buffer to external process
    :w !bash                send buffer contents to bash
                            TODO: doesn't work with unsaved contents

FILTER buffer contents through shell command (acme!) - http://stackoverflow.com/a/790218/152142
    In normal mode, ! is an operator (action) like y/d/c. You can do: 
        !!
        {range}!!
        !{motion}{shell cmd} (e.g. !Gls<cr>)
    Instead of :.!date write "date" in a buffer, then (in normal mode): 
        !!bash<cr>

    :{range}! filters a range of lines through a command and replaces those 
    lines with the output.

    examples (normal mode):
        :%!             filters the whole buffer
        !{space}{cmd}   replace the current line with <cmd> stdout
        !{space}sh      run the current line as a shell command
        !Gsort          equivalent to :.,$!sort

REDIRECT messages (all output from all vim commands)
    :redir >> [file]
    :redir @x          redirect to register 'x'
    :redir END
    :let @x = system('ls')  store shell command output to register x

    example: write output from :changes to register 'x'
        :set nomore | redir @x | changes | redir END | set more
    then read into another buffer:
        <c-r>=@x

REGISTERS: http://stackoverflow.com/a/3997110/152142
    "=          expression register
                eg: "=command_or_&variable<cr>p
    ""          unnamed register (always gets written-to)
    ".          the last inserted text
    "_          blackhole register
    "0          contains the last yank
    "1-"9       contain the last 9 deletions
    y"x         yank line to register x
    yy"X        *append* line to register x

    example: replace word with last-yanked text
        ciw<C-r>0

    example (acme!): increment register x and insert its value
        let @x=@x+1 | exe 'norm i' . @x

fundamental:
    capitalizing (shift) performs the "inverse" of the command
    .             repeat the previous command
    :5,42[cmd]    prepend a range to any command
                  range can be defined by a search:
                    :/^start of test/+1,/^end of test/-1w! Xtest.c

modifiers:
    *,#  search "whole word" under cursor
    f    forward
    t    til

special buffers:
    q:
    q/

search
    ';' is a special offset to "chain" searches. Example:
        ab/;/cd     search for "cd" after the next "ab"
    :%s/foo//gn     count matches of "foo"

substitute (search/replace):
  almost any character (following s) can be used as the delimiter:
    :%s/before/after/g
    :%s@before@after@g
  e-option:
    :%s/foo/bar/ge
                 ^--ignore errors

multi-repeat / global apply:
    :[range]g/{pattern}/[cmd]    apply cmd to lines matching {pattern}
    :[range]g!/{pattern}/[cmd]   inversion (apply to lines NOT matching)

    examples: 
        print all matches of /re/:   http://stackoverflow.com/a/509720/152142
            :g/re/p
        change (substitute) foo to bar only on #comment lines:
            :g/^\s*#/s/foo/bar/g
        delete lines that match foo:
            :g/foo/normal dd
        append all lines matching foo to register a:
            :g/foo/normal "Ay
            :g/foo/y A
        append the result of col('.') to lines 265-292:
            265,292s/$/\=col('.')/
                        ^--- use \= for per-line evaluation

rubydo, pydo, perldo, luado, ...
    reverse lines 1-5
        :1,5luado return line:reverse()
    prepend each line with its length
        :pydo return str(len(line)) + line
    reverse WORDs on current line
        :.perldo $_ = join ' ', reverse split
    insert a random string of 8 characters (A-Z) at the end of every line
        :rubydo $_ += ' ' + (1..8).collect{('A'..'Z').to_a[rand 26]}.join

macros (complex-repeat):
    qx  start recording in register x 
    q   stop recording
    @x  execute the text in register x 
        example (acme!): yank any text, then execute with @"
    @@  replay the most recent macro
    @:  repeat the last command!

window management:
    ctrl-w-[v s o]
    ctrl-w-[c h j k l]
    ctrl-w-[= | _]
    zN<enter>               resize vim height to N (useful for...?)

buffer hopping:
    ctrl-^ :ls

file management (netrw):
    :E     browse directory of current buffer (_not_ the :pwd directory)
    :Vex   browse directory of current buffer in a new split window

OPEN file/uri:
    gx              open url 
    [ctrl-w]gf      open file [in new window]

MOVE through text:
    gg G 0 $ f t ; % 
    ]} ]] ) } 
    e E ge gE    move to end of word
    w W          move to next word
    [count]%     move to [count] percentage in the file

MOVE through changes and jumps:
    g; g,           jump up/down the changes stack
    gi              enter insert-mode at the location of the last insert
    `.              jump to the very last change *in the buffer*
    ctrl-o ctrl-i   jump up/down the jumps stack
    ``              jump to the last jump *in the buffer*

undo:
    :earlier 5m
    :later 30s
    :earlier 1f     go to the last saved state

WHAT I LEARNED FROM GITHUB
==========================
AFFIRMATIONS of common project management wisdom:
    - it is often better to let a request sit for a while (weeks, months)
      because users change their minds, or other developments in the project
      obviate the feature request.

NEW USER NOTES
==============
https://github.com/google/glaive
https://github.com/google/maktaba

vim is a concept
    - modal editing, atomic edits, edit grammar
    - can be implemented in any editor/IDE
vim is a component
    - can be embedded in other applications/IDEs
vim is _not_ a platform (unlike emacs)
vim vs emacs:
    - worse is better?
        1 VimL is more accessible than elisp, for the 80% of programmers who are only comfortable with
          a conventional non-lisp language.
        2 vim is a DSL for editing text. it turns out that most users--most _power_ users--
          do not care about infinite extensibility. What matters for an editor is:
            - it fills the gap between shell scripts (or a 4GL for those who don't know scripting)
              and copy-paste. Macros + vim-regex + ex commands + text-objects + composable & repeatable
              operations fill that gap better than anything else so far.
              - one-liners like :g/r/e/<cmd> are a major component of that DSL.
                elisp (general-purpose language) isn't conducive to one-liners.
            - makes simple things easy and difficult things can be shelled out to external tools (unix way)
                - rewrite the universe in elisp is not a good tradeoff just to get extensibility,
                  because most users just want STDOUT & STDIN.
        - I truly love the emacs model and elegance, and I had high hopes for Light Table.
            Now I believe the real progress will come from something like atom talking
            to an nvim server. nvim + extensible core (written in a popular language)
            + webkit engine. And of course, nvim for terminal setups.
                - evil-mode is superb, and I use it happily, but configuring it
                  _and_ configuring emacs besides will harm adoption. See [1] and [2] for why users won't move to emacs for evil-mode.
    - convention over configuration (relatively...)
    - smaller surface area
    - backwards compatibility:
        - emacs plugins embrace the bleeding edge and commonly require latest emacs.
        - vim reluctance to add features means plugins must find workarounds,
          which means they will be backwards-compatible.
      work only with 24.3 or even 24.4, which is the bleeding edge.
      Most Vim plugins support 7.2.
    - emacs is "not in the business of competing": http://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/2bho80/emacs_maintainer_were_not_in_the_business_of/cj5lr7d

why was / chosen for the "search" operation?
    - / shares the same key as ? which is a reasonable mnemonic for "search".
        - but why should arbitrary key placement on the US layout determine the 
          mnemonics for a text manipulation DSL?
            - precisely because it is arbitrary, and in the end most keyboards
              can switch to US layout as needed. For the same reason that greek letters are 
              used as shorthand for a quantity-manipulation DSL--math--but the vastly
              most important function of this shorthand is to increase the density (throughput)
              and reduce friction of absorption (because remember, time complexity
              is lower-bounded by space complexity); and mnemonic is a minor incidental
              benefit that was most accessible to the originator and only helpful to the
              most curious of students today (eg, how many realize that sigma is a mnemonic
              for [S]um?). But for latin-based cultures, the mnemonics of the vim
              commands are there for the curious, as the mnemonics of greek are for 
              curious math students. The mnemonics are less intuitive for asian
              users, but the primary important result is that we have a dense
              language for text manipulation represented by economical symbols.
              From there we can move on to using the language, which is where
              the real value exists. Also from there, we can _extend_ the 
              language using the existing patterns. For example, / means search
              and g is the main "auxliary namespace" for vim commands, so g/
              can be used to prefix a namespace of advanced search functions.

scoping (local variables): 
    let g:foo = 'qux'
    let foo = 'bar'
        - does _not_ overwrite g:foo
        - cannot overwrite v:foo
        - echo g:foo => 'qux'
        - echo foo => 'bar'
    l: is almost never needed, because:
        - 'let foo' will not modify the environment _outside_ of the local function scope

don't bother with cream
don't get windows build from vim.org

the primary value of vim is:
    - composition of commands
    - repeatable
        text editing is an accidental task. in the future we might be editing ASTs, not text.
        see vim-sexp and evil+smartparen to see how the vim model applies beyond dumb text.
        (lambdu, MPS)
    - macros (record the literal keystrokes--also has a cost)

vim's "current directory" applies to the entire vim session (the current 
running instance of Vim), regardless of what file (buffer) you are 
currently using. Think of it as your "working directory" for the current 
vim session. 

lockvar: what does it do? is there a performance benefit? (no)

mbyte: mbyte is Vim's name for UTF-8 (and DBCS... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBCS#Controversy ).

:make and &makeprg are for processing the current buffer through *any* program.
The name "make" is just a historical misnomer.

"quickfix" is a historical misnomer and it is perfectly acceptable to use
this buffer for any list of annotations received from :make.

Vim refers to text documents as *buffers*. Get used to that. This is a useful
distinction, not just pedantic, because: a new file, which is not saved 
yet, doesn't have a path on the filesystem yet: it may exist only in Vim. Vim 
also has special buffers like the "quick fix" window and the "preview" window.

Vim *in the terminal* is somewhat[1] at the mercy of the terminal. Using Vim in the 
terminal makes it obvious the distinctions that perhaps were not so 
important before you started using a text editor in the terminal. Before, 
the distinction between "shell" and "terminal emulator" may have seemed
like noise. But once you start using vim on different systems, the 
quirks of the various terminal and shell implementations are brought into
relief. A terminal sends characters to the shell. Vim, in the context of 
a terminal, accepts the characters sent to it. When you enter ALT-f in
terminal Vim, one terminal may send <foo>f to Vim, another <bar>f.
The state of the terminal in this decade might seem rather frustrating, 
but c'est la vie. Powershell is the only really innovative, 
widely-deployed alternative, and while it's to be commended, it doesn't 
have a terminal-resident editor (and it's terminal is cmd.exe). So if 
using terminal-vim as your *primary* editor is too much trouble, 
just use gvim and forget about it. But that's where we are. VT-100 legacy 
is sitting on top of a massive, massive pile of tools and powershell 
isn't positioned to address.

    great explication of legacy terminal key code handling:

    http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Mapping_fast_keycodes_in_terminal_Vim
        There are two types of keycodes: terminal keycodes and Vim keycodes. Terminal keycodes look something like
            ^[[1;2A
            These are actual bytes that are sent to Vim by the terminal when we type Shift-Up, for example (on an xterm).
        Vim keycodes look like
            <S-Up>
        Vim needs its own representation of keycodes because it runs on a variety of platforms.
        Vim can act upon its own keycodes, and leave the assignment of terminal keycodes to
        autodetection or to manual setup by the user.

    terminal on Windows: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/libuv/EhwAn3y9wWo/T-yyLvVmIrYJ
        "The ability to automate interactive programs using libuv would be a killer feature,
        libuv could be used as a replacement for libexpect and node.js a replacement for expect"

    NOTE(jkeyes): emacs calls these two concepts "function keys" and "control keys".

    'unconed' (author of TermKit) comment:
        Unix magic like nested remote subshells and remote privilege escalation
        works only by accident, because the programs in between are too dumb to
        mess it up, not because of anything deliberate. Today, this means you
        still have to abort SSH sessions by typing magic sequences (return,
        tilde, period) rather than using out of band signalling, and catting
        binary files into your terminal can mess it up permanently.

sed becomes second nature as a side-effect of normal, prolific Vim usage.
Searching for ^\s.+ becomes an actually desirable thing to reach for, 
because then you can `cgn` the matches. Regex (even if quirky) becomes 
an actually desirable tool. Removing ambiguitiy from a text search 
(example: "find all lines that look like variable assignment and start with a dollar sign"),
instead of "don't bother", becomes a low-friction "yes, of course".
I had no desire to learn sed, because I always thought "I'll 
just reach for python or ruby or whatever". And yes, you can do that 
in vim too (:py :ruby :lua).

Why is <c-u> peppered all over mappings?
    Besides the obvious range that is inserted with : in visual-mode,
    a range is also inserted if you prepend : with a [count].
    This causes unwanted side effects (:h :func-range)
        Vim will call the function {range} times
        the cursor is moved to the start the line, even with a range of 1.
    A function marked with 'range' is sent magic parameters *a:firstline* *a:lastline*

wtf is noremap?
    non-recursive map

what is the difference between ttimeout and ttimeoutlen?
    " in the words of Steve Losh, "Basically this makes terminal Vim work sanely."
    "   https://bitbucket.org/sjl/dotfiles/src/tip/vim/vimrc#cl-95
    ""
    " see also "terminal" section above
    set ttimeout
    set ttimeoutlen=100 "this is for keycodes
    set timeout
    set timeoutlen=3000 "this is for mappings

marks seems useless?
    - more useful if they appear in the signs column
    - don't conserve them. use them, abuse them!
        - put them on maps like ':nnoremap / ms/'

[count] seems useless
    - don't try to be exact. If you know a target is in the same column, say,
      about 10 lines away, just mash 8j.

leader key? => leader key is for throwaway mappings.
    - merging a bunch of files opened at the command line? ':nmap ,d ]agg]nd]ndd]n'
    - record a macro in @q and then store it in a map:
        nmap ,l <c-r><c-r>q

vnoremap, noremap, xnoremap. Q: Why care about selection-mode? A: For snippets plugins.

g@ is to create an operator (like 'd'), _not_ an operand (like 'w' or a custom
motion). To "create" an operand, simply omap to a function that check v:operator.

omnifunc is _not_ the same thing as completefunc: https://github.com/guns/vim-clojure-static/blob/8bed65c3f42aaf4d906aaca93d223f62a53542ce/ftplugin/clojure.vim#L34
    completefunc: User defined completion       :h compl-function
    omnifunc:     filetype-specific completion  :h compl-omni

runtimepath is like bash $PATH. The order matters. Any VimL file in a plugin/
directory anywhere in your runtime path _is_ a plugin. You can force plugins
to run via ':runtime! foo.vim'

<Plug> mapping is just a "virtual key sequence" that can be mapped-to.
<Plug>(Foo) convention prevents timeoutlen pause caused by overlapping maps.
    http://stackoverflow.com/a/13698530/152142

.gvimrc runs after .vimrc, and exists only to disable annoying gvim defaults.

harmony with shell:
    vim -Nu <(echo 'echom "hi" | call append(1, "foo")')

http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/
    - gave vim a high-quality, accessible, attractive go-to tutorial
    - now we just need a better brand at vim.org

inclusive vs exclusive (:help inclusive)
    Vim makes a distinction between _inclusive_ and _exclusive_ motion.
    v toggles the "inclusiveness" or "exclusiveness" of a motion.
    Examples:
        dvb     inclusive `b`
        dve     exclusive `e`

UNIQUE(?) FEATURES
==========================================
persistent undo
undo tree / :earlier / :later

list sources https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/660
    Helm is like unite.vim. The idea of a unified interface for searching lists is
    really one of the next pillars of fundamental UIs (like copy & paste, files &
    directories, and URLs). Emacs and Vim provide something really unique here
    that isn't found in many other places:
        - ability to search lists using a bag of algorithms
        - ability to *sanely* define new sources (like [this](https://github.com/wellle/tmux-complete.vim/blob/master/autoload/unite/sources/tmuxcomplete.vim))
        - ability to extend and define new actions on list items
    Lists are everywhere; intelligent, effortless search should be available for every
    kind of list source you feel like you need. 

    http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/2coqzs/how_do_you_work_with_vim/cji6wuu
        Helm is a completion and narrowing framework. It provides an interface that
        allow multi-step and out-of-order searching. For example, if I
        want to search for list-package, "lis pac" or "pa ^li" will match.
